<h1>DevOps</h1>
<h2>Devops Tutorial</h2>

<P>The DevOps is the combination of two words, one is Development and other is Operations. It is a culture to promote the development and operation process collectively.</P>

<p>The DevOps tutorial will help you to learn DevOps basics and provide depth knowledge of various DevOps tools such as Git, Ansible, Docker, Puppet, Jenkins, Chef, Nagios, and Kubernetes.

<h2>What is DevOps?</h2>
<P>The DevOps is a combination of two words, one is software Development, and second is Operations. This allows a single team to handle the entire application lifecycle, from development to testing, deployment, and operations. DevOps helps you to reduce the disconnection between software developers, quality assurance (QA) engineers, and system administrators.</P>

<p>DevOps promotes collaboration between Development and Operations team to deploy code to production faster in an automated & repeatable way.


    
    
    DevOps helps to increase organization speed to deliver applications and services. It also allows organizations to serve their customers better and compete more strongly in the market.
    
    DevOps can also be defined as a sequence of development and IT operations with better communication and collaboration.
    
    DevOps has become one of the most valuable business disciplines for enterprises or organizations. With the help of DevOps, quality, and speed of the application delivery has improved to a great extent.
    
    DevOps is nothing but a practice or methodology of making "Developers" and "Operations" folks work together. DevOps represents a change in the IT culture with a complete focus on rapid IT service delivery through the adoption of agile practices in the context of a system-oriented approach.
    
    DevOps is all about the integration of the operations and development process. Organizations that have adopted DevOps noticed a 22% improvement in software quality and a 17% improvement in application deployment frequency and achieve a 22% hike in customer satisfaction. 19% of revenue hikes as a result of the successful DevOps implementation.</p>
    <h1>DevOps History</h1>
    <img src="5.jpeg" alt="">
<ul>
    
   <li>In 2009, the first conference named DevOpsdays was held in Ghent Belgium. Belgian consultant and Patrick Debois founded the conference.</li> 
    <li>In 2012, the state of DevOps report was launched and conceived by Alanna Brown at Puppet.</li>
   <li>In 2014, the annual State of DevOps report was published by Nicole Forsgren, Jez Humble, Gene Kim, and others. They found DevOps adoption was accelerating in 2014 also.</li> 
    <li>In 2015, Nicole Forsgren, Gene Kim, and Jez Humble founded DORA (DevOps Research and Assignment).</li>
   <li>In 2017, Nicole Forsgren, Gene Kim, and Jez Humble published "Accelerate: Building and Scaling High Performing Technology Organizations".</li> 
    </ul>
    <h1>DevOps Architecture Features</h1>
    <img src="6.png" alt="">
<p>Here are some key features of DevOps architecture, such as:
</p>
<li>
<li>) Automation</li>
Automation can reduce time consumption, especially during the testing and deployment phase. The productivity increases, and releases are made quicker by automation. This will lead in catching bugs quickly so that it can be fixed easily. For contiguous delivery, each code is defined through automated tests, cloud-based services, and builds. This promotes production using automated deploys.

<li>2) Collaboration</li>
The Development and Operations team collaborates as a DevOps team, which improves the cultural model as the teams become more productive with their productivity, which strengthens accountability and ownership. The teams share their responsibilities and work closely in sync, which in turn makes the deployment to production faster.

<li>3) Integration</li>
Applications need to be integrated with other components in the environment. The integration phase is where the existing code is combined with new functionality and then tested. Continuous integration and testing enable continuous development. The frequency in the releases and micro-services leads to significant operational challenges. To overcome such problems, continuous integration and delivery are implemented to deliver in a quicker, safer, and reliable manner.

<li>) Configuration management</li>
It ensures the application to interact with only those resources that are concerned with the environment in which it runs. The configuration files are not created where the external configuration to the application is separated from the source code. The configuration file can be written during deployment, or they can be loaded at the run time, depending on the environment in which it is running.</li>

<H1>What are Neural Networks?</H1>
<P></P>Neural networks mimic the basic functioning of the human brain and are inspired by how the human brain interprets information.They solve various real-time tasks because of its ability to perform computations quickly and its fast responses.
<P>Artificial Neural Network has a huge number of interconnected processing elements, also known as Nodes. These nodes are connected with other nodes using a connection link. The connection link contains weights, these weights contain the information about the input signal. Each iteration and input in turn leads to updation of these weights. After inputting all the data instances from the training data set, the final weights of the Neural Network along with its architecture is known as the Trained Neural Network. This process is called Training of Neural Networks.These trained neural networks solve specific problems as defined in the problem statement.

    Types of tasks that can be solved using an artificial neural network include Classification problems, Pattern Matching, Data Clustering, etc.</P>

    <p>In the process of training neural network one of the important hyper-parameter is the activation function and we need to make a choice regarding what activation function to use in hidden layers as well as in the output layer.

        Activation function decides, whether a neuron should be fired or not, by calculating the weighted sum of input and a bias term. Activation function can be linear or non-linear transformation, applied to the input signal and the output from the activation function is fed to the next layer of neuron as input.
        
       <h1>Basic building blocks of neural network training</h1> 
        
        Before moving to different activation functions and their derivatives it is important to mention basic building blocks of neural network training. These blocks can be divided into forward pass, measurement of network's output error and the backward pass.
        
        First, in forward pass the training instances are fed to the neural network. This results in a forward cascade of computations across the layers(using current set of weights) and network’s output prediction is calculated. Second, the network's output error is measured, that is the difference between the desired output and actual predicted output. Thirdly, in backward pass we back-propagate through each layer to measure error contribution from each connection and finally tweak the connection weights to reduce the error.
        
        Why we are interested in derivative of activation functions?
        
        When we implement back-propagation for a neural network we need to compute the gradient or the derivative of the activation functions. Therefore, one of the primary considerations while choosing activation functions is that it should be differentiable.
